# Problem 1
To obtain a distribution for $\hat{r}^2$, we'll follow basically the same procedure we used for regression coefficients: draw bootstrap samples; the a model to each; extract the value I'm concerned with; and summarize. Here, we'll use `modelr::bootstrap` to draw the samples and `broom::glance` to produce `r.squared` values. 

```{r weather_df, cache = TRUE}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```


```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density()
```

In this example, the $\hat{r}^2$ value is high, and the upper bound at 1 may be a cause for the generally skewed shape of the distribution. If we wanted to construct a confidence interval for $R^2$, we could take the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the estimates across bootstrap samples. However, because the shape isn't symmetric, using the mean +/- 1.96 times the standard error probably wouldn't work well.

We can produce a distribution for $\log(\beta_0 * \beta1)$ using a similar approach, with a bit more wrangling before we make our plot.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density()
```

As with $r^2$, this distribution is somewhat skewed and has some outliers. 

The point of this is not to say you should always use the bootstrap -- it's possible to establish "large sample" distributions for strange parameters / values / summaries in a lot of cases, and those are great to have. But it is helpful to know that there's a way to do inference even in tough cases.
